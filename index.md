# Ball Tracking Robot
  The ball tracking robot is a robot designed to track a ball through a camera, and follow it using ultrasonic sensors. One of the biggest challenge was getting the ball to be detected through the raspberry pi camera, as it took me a while to figure out how opencv really works. I also had some problems with videoCapture() and videoStream(), so I decided to use PiCamera instead of opencv to do the frame part of the robot.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

  For my second milestone, I worked on connecting the ultrasonic sensors, while trying to figure out ways to attach it to the breadboard. I wasn't able to see how I could attach the 2 other ultrasonic sensors shown on the schematic for the project, so I just attached one of them for now. One major challenge that I faced was that my connection from the battery to the VCC and Ground ports in the Raspberry Pi were pretty weak, as it would disconnect and reconnect easily, making it hard to control wirelessly. Hopefully I can fix this problem by Milestone 3, so the bot can be able to run wirelessly with the battery pack. For my final milestone, I need to be able to attach the camera and ultrasonic sensors to a stable position, and be able to code 
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

# First Milestone

  My project, the bal tracking robot, is designed to track a ball using ultrasonic sensors (distance sensors), and a built in Raspberry Pi Camera. So far, I've connected the chassis with the motors and wheels, and the battery pack installed. The Raspberry Pi's software is correctly installed, and it connects well with my moniter. I also have the breadboard attached, with all the wires connecting everything together. One major challenege I faced was the limitted amount of space, as I had to switch around the components so everything could fit. So far, the layout seems to fit everything that I need, with the exception of the PiCamera. To complete the project, my plan is to figure out how the ultrasonic sensors work, and also learn how to track the ball using openCV.  


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
